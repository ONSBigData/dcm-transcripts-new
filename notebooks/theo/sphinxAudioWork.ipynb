your examination and although some hay hands you counsel he failed semi phase a guy that pig pen[12:19] and more key thing is meant by a full moon qualifications but even if you're more news in the i guess i i kind of thing and i've known very kind i'm yes i am ease any of the things i made of and now i'm not even saying statistics because kind analysis is about having a hypothesis[12:39] and i

they found what do you on the stand about chief to have me as i passed and what you think the instructions mean by an why usual elsewhere in the whale to ask why[13:39] it the last laugh any land anywhere in a while that pays attention on do you know any qualifications for ross fighting and the abbe kind on this one says that the lounge out in the suggestions for improving the instructions now actually making a play the jury freeze[13:59] a jewish resume your aim was facing paid any formal qualifications eight achieved any laugh even penalties and now i can say plants that have to do don't see the question home front[14:19] question o. friendships no arm and this question and they found we of us fools homesickness question and nothing may just basic yeah go ahead subject matter what you think the question is oscar[14:39] exhaustive five hundred and five with the seventeenth in a qualification nine i guess sam's unintentional cowgirls have been a brown suit is the moon jonas someone turned to shit i say something that they might be a fake[14:59] i think i see it as a plastic a caicedo something big is he to meet the new saw movement ship can mean the change hands on the australian back for a saying anything that i can guess to why take metaxas last week the air[15:19] our economy and its mechanic yeah i think you put you on the stand by him completed an apprenticeship think that he can see you all sit in the discretion yet of how the g. destroyed drops of the site of the timeline that[15:39] am i to how sure are you the roams the lucy show that we think you know when you owns this question what did you include plentiful happens to this than just in any plan that comes out and i don't get a mosul[15:59] and most aloof of friendships we think of discipline sites that iraq day unchanged and comments that so vain and had a case began to them[16:19] stay with you being cute or friendships competed with in england where was he asked that says that in case of passion to nikkei outgoing u. outside and bit layouts[16:39] yeah harron says to use the questions austen you for friends it's completed within a minute we're used to compete in the

like one thing in the of a cap that and i can i'm having a frenzy anyway said the fact that sushi which you think the difference[17:19] and he did friendships and to prove he did we didn't know where i'm steve young now today and i don't see instruction that and i can now read have to think about that balance they get a ticket and that sid unit says the instructions in[17:39] the omelet you on the stand by included with friendships with you that we're outside been where was at obtained the as yet they've done outside of england and wales him weren't you on the stand the white house fighting to words i guess anywhere in the well the what the ethnic[17:59] and he that in and then when i found that they want to use on the stones boy equipment them how i can say now i think that he didn't punch the t. korea thailand and handshakes pass it does mean that depends singing it and[18:19] singing in the house and the clinton plan that's the plan yang yang yang at hand equivalents around a curve and means the same asked doesn't it say anything they did not consent to the anesthetic and supply is the chase ended sunday april it might be consistent ended from let's face it means the same thing that's fine[18:39] scientists that might offend the season that comes used what trade apprenticeship the a. arms reaching the molten friendship as i will then attention sell it to our own japanese suggestions for improving the ones in the past and show to do now[18:59] you know how you actually is like the sound and in the history of rights mean i pray they should be taking offense is any last sighting in the rest of the house and prevent that it just needs a sound like a hung on a kind man what it means now that it took me awhile and then at penn station i compete[19:19] i competed in good implants i think next cycle and need to the credit of at needed any lack sighting of rails said maybe catch fire that i am now exactly how to rephrase that she detroit each tried rephrase use your option in your words if the house[19:39] if the hand that have eaten heat an answer came to the theft and i think he had the sheds any hint of wales and the offensive but perhaps it's compete annie lennox i'm miles i fled the math be an asset k. thank you[19:59] kitty thank you found him you've owns the next question ourselves the ball to greet qualifications or why that hang around so we all thought school's policy and scorched by the great at photo to happens on the green said i guess said that you think[20:19] what you think this question is often the fact that the great you are the spent on board you on the stock market chieftain qualification that degree of roe house that graduated and what does that some degree level or above me that any thought he invests hey abby[20:39] the age that bakery a subject story events he can say is that creates that the events he added that means that you might have stayed on in damascus a phd most of the night that is that vast lands that might be great quarterback[20:59] that the great macaroni i think that they is that president to be safe i cannot out as soon can you give me an exultant agree that won't change that degrading ashen faced nine nine cousins and that he's english teachers say oh yeah good[21:19] hey i'm teaching aids is the construction on the question at occur the complications can beat any lab signing him man thought that it is the last he half iron and i think that this 'cause i just fall guy desolate rape all men[21:39] i hope that in the eye can see it now in cape town thank c. cup at a time and you have any suggestions for improving one of this injunction[21:59] to the death of the same as last time you see that coffee cakes they present advocate and provocation competed in advance and the convened a crimson glow the case and conceded that you're advising the house that we had a um mind me again[22:19] mind you again for your own schools that there was none that i am now did she decide to stop that and they can actually use the official fifth arm when you lost this question and what kind of qualifications you think of an exit[22:39] i hastened the courageous act and i pack and a degree sign his name be thinking about yeah like english degrees nafta creates a psychology degree eighties science degrees in astrophysics that's what they do to arm and isn't the muting due to whoa[22:59] you do when you keep the and we've got this spooky to anywhere in two couldn't qualifications compete in you outside into right hey i'll um i guess i'm it just[23:19] i think he's going to admitting to a degree that it competes in england and wales in a bakery activity take any blackouts that i have that and factions yet and that that uses the zone was on to me the yes also said great temptation to create the u. of h. i. v. and vi[23:39] c. n. and he fall in that kitchen as acting they send the kids i might see a man to man them that yeah they seem to me as they like the present and the case having she says i'm having a lot they are and i hate send your agency as[23:59] that indeed she is i am a fan and i think andy's yet to say that having his equipment and a half long that i didn't get to that full of satire yeah it's a teacher and messing up the p. g. see if he checked it out and singing[24:19] what i'm asking a question as if nothing to resist that big a bum now do bout examples now these two satisfied with your snake that's bad judgment is the major asian and you know jim i didn't think that if our panetta and a town that i can re elected[24:39] the u. s. that question son andy he's a headless he says he's a person for file a fine get it had the bound to what you think that this is an education is that yes that is to raise show me that there are other qualifications and i just asked me if i couldn't agree yes may i say the spell[24:59] in the stop it i think i can do you think this instructions necessary or unnecessary i think it's quite reassuring have a half a pound you have any suggestions for improvement speak so moves arm ne'er not really a good idea now in the back of our[25:19] that out of the case just common okay them had already other exalt was that you think should be out it's the latest on that yes option nina i think said hey i'm gonna stay in his reading of the speech beyond the normal she has this up[25:39] is that the dedication of a think the odds that that person that man is any cases and below it and go up again and he sounds to me amongst the next question now who chose to go in the cube of patients are given the tank[25:59] it through what you wore costumes whose views question and he advises that he may have a team for the n. n. e. t. in life ahead by the cake and that's all the options that are either[26:19] the lives and auntie me sue to you on the stand by cheating and you equipment costs qualification think that it's college and i passed when was that so many view or equivalent
